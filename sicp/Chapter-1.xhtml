<h2 class="chapter"><span class="chapnum">1</span><span class="chaptitle">Building Abstractions with Procedures</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are
chiefly these three: 1. Combining<!-- /@w --> several simple ideas into one compound one,
and thus all complex ideas are made.  2. The second<!-- /@w --> is bringing two ideas,
whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to
take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets
all its ideas of relations.  3. The third<!-- /@w --> is separating them from all other
ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction,
and thus all its general ideas are made.
</p>
<p>—John Locke, <cite>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</cite> (1690)
</p></blockquote>


<p>We are about to study the idea of a <a id="index-computational-process"></a>
<em>computational process</em>.
Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.  As they
evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called <a id="index-data"></a>
<em>data</em>.  The
evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a
<a id="index-program"></a>
<em>program</em>.  People create programs to direct processes.  In effect, we
conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
</p>
<p>A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer’s idea of a spirit.  It
cannot be seen or touched.  It is not composed of matter at all.  However, it
is very real.  It can perform intellectual work.  It can answer questions.  It
can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot
arm in a factory.  The programs we use to conjure processes are like a
sorcerer’s spells.  They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in
arcane and esoteric <a id="index-programming-languages"></a>
<em>programming languages</em> that prescribe the tasks we
want our processes to perform.
</p>
<p>A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs
precisely and accurately.  Thus, like the sorcerer’s apprentice, novice
programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of
their conjuring.  Even small errors (usually called <a id="index-bugs"></a>
<em>bugs</em> or
<a id="index-glitches"></a>
<em>glitches</em>) in programs can have complex and unanticipated
consequences.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than learning
sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently contained in a
secure way.  Real-world programming, however, requires care, expertise, and
wisdom.  A small bug in a computer-aided design program, for example, can lead
to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of
an industrial robot.
</p>
<p>Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that they
can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform the tasks
intended.  They can visualize the behavior of their systems in advance.  They
know how to structure programs so that unanticipated problems do not lead to
catastrophic consequences, and when problems do arise, they can <a id="index-debug"></a>
<em>debug</em>
their programs.  Well-designed computational systems, like well-designed
automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the
parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.
</p>
<a id="Programming-in-Lisp"></a>
<h5 class="subsubheading">Programming in Lisp</h5>

<p>We need an appropriate language for describing processes, and we will use for
this purpose the programming language Lisp.  Just as our everyday thoughts are
usually expressed in our natural language (such as English, French, or
Japanese), and descriptions of quantitative phenomena are expressed with
mathematical notations, our procedural thoughts will be expressed in Lisp.
Lisp was invented in the late 1950s as a formalism for reasoning about the use
of certain kinds of logical expressions, called <a id="index-recursion-equations"></a>
<em>recursion equations</em>,
as a model for computation.  The language was conceived by John McCarthy and is
based on his paper “Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their
Computation by Machine” (<a href="References.xhtml#McCarthy-1960">McCarthy 1960</a>).
</p>
<p>Despite its inception as a mathematical formalism, Lisp is a practical
programming language.  A Lisp <a id="index-interpreter"></a>
<em>interpreter</em> is a machine that carries
out processes described in the Lisp language.  The first Lisp interpreter was
implemented by McCarthy with the help of colleagues and students in the
Artificial Intelligence Group of the <abbr>MIT</abbr> Research Laboratory of
Electronics and in the <abbr>MIT</abbr> Computation Center.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>  Lisp, whose name is an acronym for
LISt Processing, was designed to provide symbol-manipulating capabilities for
attacking programming problems such as the symbolic differentiation and
integration of algebraic expressions.  It included for this purpose new data
objects known as atoms and lists, which most strikingly set it apart from all
other languages of the period.
</p>
<p>Lisp was not the product of a concerted design effort.  Instead, it evolved
informally in an experimental manner in response to users’ needs and to
pragmatic implementation considerations.  Lisp’s informal evolution has
continued through the years, and the community of Lisp users has traditionally
resisted attempts to promulgate any “official” definition of the language.
This evolution, together with the flexibility and elegance of the initial
conception, has enabled Lisp, which is the second oldest language in widespread
use today (only Fortran is older), to continually adapt to encompass the most
modern ideas about program design.  Thus, Lisp is by now a family of dialects,
which, while sharing most of the original features, may differ from one another
in significant ways.  The dialect of Lisp used in this book is called
Scheme.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Because of its experimental character and its emphasis on symbol manipulation,
Lisp was at first very inefficient for numerical computations, at least in
comparison with Fortran.  Over the years, however, Lisp compilers have been
developed that translate programs into machine code that can perform numerical
computations reasonably efficiently.  And for special applications, Lisp has
been used with great effectiveness.<a class="footnote_link" id="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>  
Although Lisp has not yet overcome its old reputation as
hopelessly inefficient, Lisp is now used in many applications where efficiency
is not the central concern.  For example, Lisp has become a language of choice
for operating-system shell languages and for extension languages for editors
and computer-aided design systems.
</p>
<p>If Lisp is not a mainstream language, why are we using it as the framework for
our discussion of programming?  Because the language possesses unique features
that make it an excellent medium for studying important programming constructs
and data structures and for relating them to the linguistic features that
support them.  The most significant of these features is the fact that Lisp
descriptions of processes, called <a id="index-procedures"></a>
<em>procedures</em>, can themselves be
represented and manipulated as Lisp data.  The importance of this is that there
are powerful program-design techniques that rely on the ability to blur the
traditional distinction between “passive” data and “active” processes.  As
we shall discover, Lisp’s flexibility in handling procedures as data makes it
one of the most convenient languages in existence for exploring these
techniques.  The ability to represent procedures as data also makes Lisp an
excellent language for writing programs that must manipulate other programs as
data, such as the interpreters and compilers that support computer languages.
Above and beyond these considerations, programming in Lisp is great fun.

The two dialects in which most major Lisp programs of the
1970s were written are MacLisp (<a href="References.xhtml#Moon-1978">Moon 1978</a>; <a href="References.xhtml#Pitman-1983">Pitman 1983</a>), developed at the
<abbr>MIT</abbr> Project <abbr>MAC</abbr>, and Interlisp (<a href="References.xhtml#Teitelman-1974">Teitelman 1974</a>), developed
at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.
Portable Standard Lisp (<a href="References.xhtml#Hearn-1969">Hearn 1969</a>; <a href="References.xhtml#Griss-1981">Griss 1981</a>) was a Lisp dialect designed to
be easily portable between different machines.  MacLisp spawned a number of
subdialects, such as Franz Lisp, which was developed at the University of
California at Berkeley, and Zetalisp (<a href="References.xhtml#Moon-and-Weinreb-1981">Moon and Weinreb 1981</a>), which was based on a
special-purpose processor designed at the <abbr>MIT</abbr> Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory to run Lisp very efficiently.  The Lisp dialect used in this book,
called Scheme (<a href="References.xhtml#Steele-and-Sussman-1975">Steele and Sussman 1975</a>), was invented in 1975 by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and
Gerald Jay Sussman of the <abbr>MIT</abbr> Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and
later reimplemented for instructional use at <abbr>MIT</abbr>.  Scheme became an
<abbr>IEEE</abbr> standard in 1990 (<a href="References.xhtml#IEEE-1990">IEEE 1990</a>).  The Common Lisp dialect
(<a href="References.xhtml#Steele-1982">Steele 1982</a>, <a href="References.xhtml#Steele-1990">Steele 1990</a>) was developed by the Lisp community to combine
features from the earlier Lisp dialects to make an industrial standard for
Lisp.  Common Lisp became an <abbr>ANSI</abbr> standard in 1994 (<a href="References.xhtml#ANSI-1994">ANSI 1994</a>).</p>

One such special application was a
breakthrough computation of scientific importance—an integration of the
motion of the Solar System that extended previous results by nearly two orders
of magnitude, and demonstrated that the dynamics of the Solar System is
chaotic.  This computation was made possible by new integration algorithms, a
special-purpose compiler, and a special-purpose computer all implemented with
the aid of software tools written in Lisp (<a href="References.xhtml#Abelson-et-al_002e-1992">Abelson et al. 1992</a>; <a href="References.xhtml#Sussman-and-Wisdom-1992">Sussman and Wisdom 1992</a>).</p>
